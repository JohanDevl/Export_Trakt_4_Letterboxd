feat(refactor): Implement code restructuring and modularization (#12)

This commit restructures the codebase to follow a modular pattern, improving maintainability, readability,
and extensibility. The changes address Issue #12 (Code Restructuring and Modularization).

Key improvements:
- Split monolithic script into focused modules with specific responsibilities
- Created a lib/ directory with 5 specialized modules:
  - config.sh: Configuration management
  - utils.sh: Utility functions and debugging
  - trakt_api.sh: API interaction functions
  - data_processing.sh: Data transformation functions
  - main.sh: Main orchestration module
- Added new install.sh script for streamlined setup
- Simplified the main Export_Trakt_4_Letterboxd.sh script
- Updated README.md to reflect new structure
- Added detailed documentation in docs/MODULARIZATION.md

The functionality remains intact while providing a more maintainable foundation for future enhancements.
