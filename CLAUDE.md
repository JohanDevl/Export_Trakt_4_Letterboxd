### Key Architectural Patterns

**Performance Layer**: The application uses a 3-tier performance optimization:
1. **Worker Pool System** (`pkg/performance/pool/`) - Concurrent processing of API requests
2. **LRU Cache** (`pkg/performance/cache/`) - Caches API responses to reduce calls by 70-90%
3. **Streaming Processor** (`pkg/streaming/`) - Memory-efficient processing of large datasets

**Security Layer**: Enterprise-grade security with:
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication** (`pkg/auth/`) - Modern OAuth 2.0 authentication with automatic token refresh
- **Keyring Integration** (`pkg/security/keyring/`) - Secure credential storage across multiple backends
- **Encryption** (`pkg/security/encryption/`) - AES encryption for sensitive data
- **Audit Logging** (`pkg/security/audit/`) - Comprehensive security event logging
- **Rate Limiting** (`pkg/security/ratelimit.go`) - API rate limiting protection

**Resilience Layer**: Built-in resilience patterns:
- **Circuit Breaker** (`pkg/retry/circuit/`) - Prevents cascading failures
- **Exponential Backoff** (`pkg/retry/backoff/`) - Smart retry logic
- **Checkpoints** (`pkg/resilience/checkpoints/`) - Resume interrupted operations

**Monitoring Layer**: Full observability stack:
- **Prometheus Metrics** (`pkg/monitoring/metrics/`) - Application metrics
- **OpenTelemetry Tracing** (`pkg/monitoring/tracing/`) - Distributed tracing
- **Health Checks** (`pkg/monitoring/health/`) - Application health monitoring
- **Alerting** (`pkg/monitoring/alerts/`) - Alert management

## Export Modes

The application supports two distinct export modes for watched movies:

### Aggregated Mode (Default)
- **Behavior**: One entry per unique movie with the most recent watch date
- **Use Case**: Standard export compatible with original Letterboxd import expectations
- **Configuration**: `history_mode = "aggregated"` or `--history-mode aggregated`
- **Output**: Single CSV row per movie, rewatch flag based on total play count

### Individual History Mode (New)
- **Behavior**: One entry per viewing event with complete watch history
- **Use Case**: Detailed tracking of all viewing dates and proper rewatch sequences
- **Configuration**: `history_mode = "individual"` or `--history-mode individual`
- **Output**: Multiple CSV rows per movie (one per viewing), chronological rewatch tracking
- **Data Source**: Uses `/sync/history/movies` API endpoint with 'watch' and 'scrobble' actions
- **Benefits**: 
  - Complete viewing history preservation
  - Accurate rewatch tracking (first watch = false, subsequent = true)
  - Chronological sorting (most recent first)
  - Same rating applied consistently across all viewings of a movie

**Example Individual Mode Output:**
```csv
Title,Year,WatchedDate,Rating10,imdbID,tmdbID,Rewatch
Cars,2006,2025-07-10,7,tt0317219,920,true
Cars,2006,2024-12-01,7,tt0317219,920,false
```

## Configuration Management

Configuration is handled through TOML files with the following priority:
1. Command-line flags
2. Environment variables
3. `config/config.toml` file
4. `config/config.example.toml` defaults

Key configuration files:
- `config/config.example.toml` - Complete configuration template with security features
- `config/performance.toml` - Performance optimization settings

## Security Considerations

The application implements multiple security layers:
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Modern authentication flow with PKCE and automatic token refresh
- **Credential Management**: Uses system keyring, environment variables, or encrypted files
- **Multi-Backend Token Storage**: Supports system keyring, file encryption, and environment variables
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Configurable requirement for HTTPS-only communications
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed security event logging with configurable retention
- **File Permissions**: Secure file creation and access controls

## Testing Strategy

The codebase maintains high test coverage (78%+) with:
- **Unit Tests**: All major packages have comprehensive test coverage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Benchmark Tests**: Performance testing for critical paths
- **Security Tests**: Security feature validation

Critical test files:
- `pkg/performance/benchmarks_test.go` - Performance benchmarks
- `pkg/security/manager_test.go` - Security feature tests
- `pkg/api/trakt_test.go` - API client tests

## Performance Characteristics

Recent performance optimizations deliver:
- **10x throughput improvement** via worker pool system
- **70-90% API call reduction** through LRU caching
- **80% memory reduction** with streaming processing
- **Sub-second response times** for most operations

## Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages through the `pkg/i18n` package:
- Message keys are used throughout the codebase
- Translation files are located in `locales/` directory
- Supported languages: English, French, German, Spanish

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling system:
- **Error Types** (`pkg/errors/types/`) - Structured error definitions
- **Error Handlers** (`pkg/errors/handlers/`) - Centralized error handling
- **Error Recovery** (`pkg/errors/recovery/`) - Panic recovery mechanisms
- **Validation** (`pkg/errors/validation/`) - Input validation with detailed error messages

## Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes**: Edit code following existing patterns
2. **Run Tests**: Execute `go test ./...` to ensure no regressions
3. **Check Coverage**: Use `./scripts/coverage.sh` to verify coverage meets 70% threshold
4. **Build**: Use `go build -o export_trakt ./cmd/export_trakt/`
5. **Test Integration**: Use Docker Compose profiles for integration testing
6. **Security Check**: Run `./export_trakt --validate-security` for security validation

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions with:
- **Go Tests** (.github/workflows/go-tests.yml) - Testing with 57% minimum coverage
- **Docker Build** (.github/workflows/docker-build.yml) - Multi-platform container builds
- **Security Scan** (.github/workflows/security-scan.yml) - gosec, trivy, and dependency scanning
- **Release** (.github/workflows/release.yml) - Automated release creation

## Common Patterns

**Structured Logging**: All log messages use structured format with message keys:
```go
log.Info("export.starting", map[string]interface{}{
    "export_type": exportType,
    "timestamp": time.Now(),
})
```

**Configuration Access**: Use dependency injection for configuration:
```go
func NewClient(cfg *config.Config, log logger.Logger) *Client {
    return &Client{config: cfg, logger: log}
}
```

**Error Handling**: Use structured error types with context:
```go
return fmt.Errorf("failed to export movies: %w", err)
```

**Performance Optimization**: Leverage worker pools for concurrent operations:
```go
pool := workerPool.New(cfg.Performance.WorkerCount)
defer pool.Close()
```

When making changes, always follow existing architectural patterns and maintain the security-first approach. The codebase emphasizes reliability, performance, and security over simplicity.
