# GitHub Actions Workflow Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the GitHub Actions workflow used in this project to build and publish Docker images to the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).

## Overview

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` and performs the following tasks:

1. Builds a Docker image from the project
2. Pushes the image to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
3. Signs the image using Cosign for security

## Workflow Triggers

The workflow is triggered by:

- **Schedule**: Runs daily at 15:32 UTC (`cron: "32 15 * * *"`)
- **Push to main branch**: Any commits pushed to the `main` branch
- **Version tags**: Any tags matching the pattern `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Pull requests**: Any pull requests targeting the `main` branch

## Workflow Steps

The workflow consists of the following main steps:

1. **Checkout repository**: Fetches the code from the repository
2. **Install Cosign**: Sets up Cosign for image signing (except on PRs)
3. **Set up Docker Buildx**: Configures Docker for multi-platform builds
4. **Log into registry**: Authenticates with GitHub Container Registry (except on PRs)
5. **Extract Docker metadata**: Prepares tags and labels for the image
6. **Build and push Docker image**: Builds the image and pushes it to the registry (except on PRs)
7. **Sign the published Docker image**: Signs the image using Cosign (except on PRs)

## Testing the Workflow

### Local Testing with `act`

You can test the workflow locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
# Install act
# macOS
brew install act

# Linux
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Run the workflow for a push event
act push

# Run the workflow for a specific event
act workflow_dispatch
```

Note: Some features like Cosign signing might not work correctly in local testing.

### Testing on GitHub

To test the workflow on GitHub:

1. **Push to main branch**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test GitHub Actions workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create and push a version tag**:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Manual trigger**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to "Actions" tab
   - Select the "Docker" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" dropdown
   - Select the branch and click "Run workflow"

## Customizing the Workflow

### Changing the Schedule

To change when the workflow runs automatically, modify the `cron` expression in the `schedule` section:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "32 15 * * *" # Current: 15:32 UTC daily
```

Common cron examples:

- `0 0 * * *`: Daily at midnight UTC
- `0 */6 * * *`: Every 6 hours
- `0 0 * * 0`: Weekly on Sunday at midnight UTC

### Changing the Registry

The workflow is configured to push to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io). To use a different registry:

1. Modify the `REGISTRY` environment variable:

   ```yaml
   env:
     REGISTRY: docker.io # For Docker Hub
   ```

2. Update the authentication step with appropriate credentials.

### Multi-Platform Builds

The workflow is set up for multi-platform builds using Docker Buildx. To specify platforms, add a `platforms` parameter to the build-and-push step:

```yaml
- name: Build and push Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5.0.0
  with:
    context: .
    push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
    tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
    labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
    platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**:

   - Ensure your GitHub token has the necessary permissions
   - Check that the repository has packages write permissions

2. **Build Failures**:

   - Check the Dockerfile for errors
   - Ensure all required files are included in the repository

3. **Signing Issues**:
   - Verify Cosign is installed correctly
   - Check that the identity token is available

### Viewing Workflow Logs

To view detailed logs:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to the "Actions" tab
3. Click on the specific workflow run
4. Expand the job and step that failed to see detailed logs
