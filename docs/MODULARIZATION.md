# Code Restructuring and Modularization

This document outlines the changes made as part of Issue #12 to restructure and modularize the Export Trakt 4 Letterboxd codebase.

## Overview

The original script was a single monolithic file (`Export_Trakt_4_Letterboxd.sh`) containing all functionality. This approach made maintenance challenging, limited reusability, and complicated debugging efforts.

The restructuring involved breaking down the script into separate modules, each with a specific responsibility. This improves code maintainability, testability, and facilitates future enhancements.

## New Structure

The codebase now follows a modular structure:

```
Export_Trakt_4_Letterboxd/
├── lib/                     # Library modules
│   ├── config.sh            # Configuration management
│   ├── utils.sh             # Utility functions and debugging
│   ├── trakt_api.sh         # API interaction functions
│   ├── data_processing.sh   # Data transformation functions
│   └── main.sh              # Main orchestration module
├── Export_Trakt_4_Letterboxd.sh # Main script (simplified)
└── install.sh               # New installation script
```

## Module Responsibilities

### 1. lib/config.sh

Handles all configuration-related functionality:

- Loading configuration files
- Setting up directories (logs, copies, temp, backup)
- OS detection for cross-platform compatibility
- Environment logging

### 2. lib/utils.sh

Contains utility functions used across the application:

- Debug message formatting and logging
- File information inspection
- Dependency checking
- Progress bar visualization
- Error handling

### 3. lib/trakt_api.sh

Manages all interactions with the Trakt API:

- Token refresh and validation
- API endpoint determination based on mode
- Data fetching with proper error handling
- Authentication management

### 4. lib/data_processing.sh

Focuses on processing and transforming the data:

- Creating lookup tables for ratings and play counts
- Processing movie history with timestamps and ratings
- Managing watched movies with deduplication
- Creating backup archives
- CSV file generation for Letterboxd

### 5. lib/main.sh

Acts as the orchestrator for the entire process:

- Imports all required modules
- Initializes the environment
- Processes command line arguments
- Coordinates the data fetching and processing steps
- Handles the export workflow

## New Installation Experience

A new `install.sh` script has been added to simplify the setup process. This script:

- Creates all required directories
- Checks for required dependencies
- Sets up the configuration file
- Sets appropriate file permissions
- Guides the user through the next steps

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility, making code easier to maintain.
2. **Testability**: Functions are isolated, enabling more effective testing.
3. **Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to read and understand.
4. **Extensibility**: New features can be added by extending specific modules without affecting others.
5. **Debugging**: Issues can be traced to specific modules, simplifying the debugging process.

## Migration Notes

The functionality of the original script remains intact, with the following improvements:

- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Better progress reporting during operations
- Improved cross-platform compatibility
- Clearer separation of concerns
- More robust dependency checking
- Simplified main script

## Future Enhancements

This modular structure facilitates future enhancements such as:

1. Adding unit tests for individual functions
2. Implementing additional data export formats
3. Supporting more API endpoints and data types
4. Enhancing the user interface (CLI or web-based)
5. Extending support for other services beyond Letterboxd

## Conclusion

The restructuring provides a solid foundation for maintaining and extending the Export Trakt 4 Letterboxd tool. The modular approach ensures that the codebase remains manageable as it grows and evolves with new features and improvements.
