## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying Export Trakt 4 Letterboxd:

#### üîë **API Security**

- **Rotate your Trakt.tv API tokens regularly**
- **Use environment variables** or secure secret management for API credentials
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Limit API token permissions** to the minimum required scope

#### üê≥ **Docker Security**

```bash
# Use specific version tags, not 'latest' in production
docker pull johandevl/export-trakt-4-letterboxd:v2.1.0

# Run with limited privileges
docker run --user 1000:1000 --read-only \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/exports:/app/exports \
  johandevl/export-trakt-4-letterboxd:v2.1.0

# Use Docker secrets for sensitive data
echo "your-api-token" | docker secret create trakt-token -
```

#### üîí **Configuration Security**

```toml
# config.toml - Secure configuration example
[trakt]
client_id = "${TRAKT_CLIENT_ID}"      # Use environment variables
client_secret = "${TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET}"
access_token = "${TRAKT_ACCESS_TOKEN}"

[logging]
level = "info"                        # Avoid debug logs in production
file = "logs/export.log"
max_size = "10MB"                     # Limit log file sizes

[export]
output_dir = "./exports"              # Use relative paths when possible
```

#### üåê **Network Security**

- **Use HTTPS** for all API communications (default)
- **Consider using a VPN** for sensitive environments
- **Firewall rules** to limit outbound connections if needed
- **Monitor network traffic** for unexpected connections

#### üìÅ **File System Security**

```bash
# Set appropriate file permissions
chmod 600 config/config.toml          # Config file readable only by owner
chmod 755 exports/                    # Export directory
chmod 644 exports/*.csv               # Export files

# Use dedicated user for running the application
useradd -r -s /bin/false export-user
chown -R export-user:export-user /app/
```

### For Developers

#### üîç **Code Security**

- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and API responses
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and audit regularly
- **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode secrets in source code

#### üß™ **Security Testing**

```bash
# Static analysis
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run

# Dependency vulnerability scanning
go list -json -m all | nancy sleuth

# Security audit
gosec ./...

# Container scanning
docker scan johandevl/export-trakt-4-letterboxd:latest
```

#### üì¶ **Build Security**

- **Reproducible builds** with pinned dependencies
- **Signed releases** for binary distributions
- **Multi-stage Docker builds** to minimize attack surface
- **Regular base image updates**

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Automated Security

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **Container Scanning**: Regular Docker image vulnerability scans
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated security updates via Dependabot

### Manual Reviews

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo security-focused review
- **Security Audits**: Regular manual security assessments
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security testing of the application
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular assessment of potential attack vectors
